# docker-migrid-ucphhpc
Add-ons for use in docker-migrid at the Science HPC Center at University of Copenhagen. A collection of environment and conf files that we can use for our docker-migrid instances.

Any site-specific files that don't fit in the generic docker-migrid repo can go here instead and just be referenced in the docker-migrid clone or deployment.
