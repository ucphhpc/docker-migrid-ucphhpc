  # The migrid core services including httpd and tightly integrated services
  # like job handling (grid script, monitor, sshmux, imnoty and vmproxy)

  # NOTE: in order to test the publishing of container services on the host
  #       with standard ports on 1.2.3.x one can set up a local dummy device:
  #       sudo ip link add dummylan type dummy
  #       sudo ip addr add 1.2.3.1/24 dev dummylan
  #       sudo ip link set dummylan up
  #
  #       Then use the local firewall to forward the standard low service ports
  #       to the exposed high ones.
